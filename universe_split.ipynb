    "The equation can be interpreted as follows: $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$ is a quantum state that describes the probability of finding the system under a certain configuration. For instance, when measuring the position of an isolated particle,  $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$ is a probability distribution that describes the probability of the particle showing up at every possible location. The equation describes how the values of this probability distribution change over time ($t$), in a way that depends on the energy of the system, expressed by the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)) $\\hat H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to use the Schrödinger equation to describe complex systems we find out soon enough that the probability distribution $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$ can be very hard to define: even a single particle could be located at any point in a continuous space. Therefore, we would need to define a probability value for every possible location, resulting in an infinite number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, when focusing on very simple measurements like the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a single particle, this can only take two values: up and down. Therefore, the $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$ for the spin of a particle can be defined as a vector with just two entries: the probability of finding an up-spin or a down-spin. This also means there are two basic quantum states  for this system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $|0\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{matrix}1\\\\0\\end{matrix} \\right)$: all the probability is concentrated in the first possible outcome (for instance, spin-down)\n",

    "On top of these basic states we can also find any combination or superposition in the form $|q\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\end{matrix} \\right) = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$. [Born's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule) tells us that for such a state, the probability of observing the first outcome would be $|\\alpha|^2$ and for the second outcome $|\\beta|^2$. $|q\\rangle$ must meet $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$ in order to fulfill the rules of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are well-known facts of quantum mechanics, which have been very useful to advance the field of physics. But the big question here is: why quantum phenomena exhibit this random behavior, when classical physics is deterministic? Why a particle does not have a definite position, but rather a distribution at which we might observe this particle? Different interpretations of the Schrödinger equation give rise to different realizations on how the universe works. One of them, the Everett interpretation, tells an amazing story about this fact."

    "In this experiment, a cat is trapped inside a box, in a way that is completely isolated from the enviroment. The box also contains a detector holding a poisonous gas, and a radioactive atom. Because of the dynamics of radioactivity, the atom will decay at some point and generate radiation, which will activate the detector and release the toxic gas, thus killing the unfortunate cat. The riddle to solve in this setting is: after a certain amount of time, is the cat dead or alive?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is quite hard to answer, because radioactive decay is something we observe as a random process: we can't be sure if at a certain moment of time the atom has decayed and generated radiation. Actually, radioactivity is a quantum process, so we have a quantum state describing the probability of observing the atom before ($⚛️$) or after the decay ($⚡$)\n",

At this point, the detector has no uncertainty about the state of the atom, because a definite measurement has been performed. However, according to Everett interpretation the result is different: the detector gets **entangled** with the quantum state of the particle, resulting in the following quantum state\n",

From the point of view of an external observer, we can't tell whether the cat is dead or alive, since both states exist in superposition, and this is the reason why the famous Schrödinger's cat is dead and alive at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can twist the experiment a little bit more. Suppose the box with the cat is inside a larger, isolated room, where a scientist is observing the experiment. If the scientist decides to open the box, he will observe the cat being either dead or alive... but the scientist is also in an isolated environment: what makes he so special, so that he doesn't get entangled like the detector or the cat? Actually, nothing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, what happens if we break the containment of the experimental room? Then the room is no longer isolated, and this quantum system in superposition gets entangled with... everything in the universe in contact with the experimental room 🌌\n",

    "* 🌌-$\\alpha$: where the cat is alive 🐱 and the scientist is happy 😃.\n",
    "* 🌌-$\\beta$: where the cat is dead 🙀 and the scientist is sad for this terrible outcome 😢.\n",
