    "Note that all the quantum teleporations done in this notebook have been simulated. It is theoretically possible to run the same circuits in real quantum devices, though it would be very hard: we would need to distribute an entangled quantum pair to two different computers, without losing such entanglement due to interferences. This is something extremely difficult to do, though it has [already been accomplished by chinese scientists to send information to a satellite](https://www.space.com/37506-quantum-teleportation-record-shattered.html)! So, at some point in the future we might be able to use quantum teleporation for sending information securely."
